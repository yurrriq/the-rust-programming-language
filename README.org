* The Rust Programming Language

[[https://www.rust-lang.org][Rust]] is well beyond 1.0 now and has been on my radar for quite a while,
so I figured it's worth checking out.

Lucky for me, [[https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html][the Rust team]] has prepared [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/][a book]].

This repo is mostly for my own posterity, but if someone else finds it useful,
great!

All credit goes to [[https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html][the Rust team]]. I'm simply working through the examples
they've made [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/][available online]]. Thanks!
